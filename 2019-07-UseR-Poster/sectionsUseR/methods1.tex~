\subsection{Based on Conditional Mutual Information}

When studying methylation we are faced with two main questions:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Which genes exhibit an L-shape, and 
  \item What is the optimal threshold for binarizing
methylation data for each L-shape gene.
  \end{enumerate}
  
To determine whether methylation and expression of a gene exhibit an L-shape,
compute the conditional Mutual Information (MI) for different choices of threshold. % to binarize the methylation data.

If we consider the continuous valued methylation and expression data as two random variables
$X$ and $Y$, and denote a nominal threshold as $t$, the conditional MI can be written as: %  a weighted sum of MIs on the two sides of the threshold.
\[
\mathit{cMI}(t)=I(X,Y|X>t)P(X>t) + I(X,Y|X\le t)P(X\le t)
\]
%When $t$ is $0$ or $1$, $\mathit{cMI}$ equals to the mutual information derived 
%from all data points.

For an L-shape gene, as $t$ moves from 0 to 1, $\mathit{cMI}(t)$ first decreases and then increases, its value approaching zero when $t$ coincides with the reflection point.
