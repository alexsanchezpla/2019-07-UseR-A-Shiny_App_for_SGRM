\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Methylation %of CpG dinucleotides in the promoter 
of genes involved in the oncogenic process is a key process contributing to tumor initiation and/or progression\cite{sadikovic:2008}. 

\item Finding \textit{Genes Regulated by Methylation} or GRM can lead to a better understanding and be a guide to finding new drug targets.

\item This study originates in a work searching for colon cancer biomarkers \cite{bazzocco}. Cell lines with increasing sensitivity to a chemotherapy drug, were analyzed with Expression and Methylation arrays.  Finding GRM was used to search of candidate genes for new therapies.

\item In cancer--related genes it is common to observe a decrease in gene expression associated with hypermethylation. Methylation is often described as a binary on-off signal (\cite{Liu})
that is, when methylation is ``off'' the gene can express normally and
its expression will be low or high, whereas when methylation
is ``on'', the expression of the gene will be \emph{repressed} and its
values will tend to be low.

\item As a consequence of this \emph{high-methylation/low-expression} and
\emph{low-methylation/high-expression} relation plots depicting 
methylation and expression will show L--shape patterns so the
strategy adopted will be to mine such plots and select those that
have such a shape.
