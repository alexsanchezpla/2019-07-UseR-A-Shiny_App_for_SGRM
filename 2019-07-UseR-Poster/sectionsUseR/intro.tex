\section{Background}

\begin{itemize}
\item Methylation %of CpG dinucleotides in the promoter 
of genes involved in the oncogenic process is a key process contributing to tumor initiation and/or progression \cite{sadikovic:2008}. 

\item Finding \textit{Genes Regulated by Methylation} (GRM) can lead to a better understanding and be a guide to finding new drug targets.

%\item This study originates in a work searching for colon cancer biomarkers \cite{bazzocco}. Cell lines with increasing sensitivity to a chemotherapy drug, were analyzed with Expression and Methylation arrays.  Finding GRM was used to search of candidate genes for new therapies.

\item In cancer--related genes it is common to observe a decrease in gene expression associated with hypermethylation.
\begin{itemize}
	\item  When methylation is low (``off'') the gene can express normally and
	its expression may be any value, low or high, 
	\item when methylation is medium or high (``on''), the expression of the gene will be \emph{repressed} and its values will tend to be low .
\end{itemize}
\item As a consequence relation plots depicting 
methylation and expression may show L--shape patterns so the
strategy adopted will be to mine such plots and select those that
have such a shape.

\end{itemize}
