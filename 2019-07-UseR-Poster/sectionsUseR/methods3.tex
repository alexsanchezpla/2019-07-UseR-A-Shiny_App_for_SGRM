\subsection{Heuristic approach}
A heuristic method has been developed basing on imitating the visual selection of L-shapes (see figure)
\begin{itemize}
\item Overimpose a $3\times 3$ grid on the scatterplot.
\item Score points on each subgrid in such a way that
\begin{itemize}
	\item Points in permitted regions increase score
	\item Points in non-desired regions decrease score
	\item Points in non-allowed regions set score to $\-infty$.
\end{itemize}
\item Use cross-validation to tune scoring parameters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Naive method}

Traditionally selection has been based on searching for genes with negative correlation betweem expression and correlation. This ``Na√Øve approach" is used to compare with other approaches.
