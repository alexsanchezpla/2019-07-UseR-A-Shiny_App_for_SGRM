\section{Results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We developed a heuristic method based on imitating the visual selection of L-shapes by overimposing a $3\times 3$ grid on the scatterplot (\cite{sanchez:2019}).

	\item The algorithm has been implemented in R (package ready-to-be-submitted to Bioconductor).
	\item A Shiny application has been created to select genes potentially regulated by methylation using a combination of the \textit{Lheuristic} method and a \textit{na√Øve} approach (negative correlation).	
\end{itemize}
