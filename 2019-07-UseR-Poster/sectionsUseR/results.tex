\begin {itemize}
\item All methods yield some L-shaped genes
\item L-shape\textit{ is a surrogate for methylation}: Lack of empirical knowlege of methylated genes avoids, by now, to turn it into a supervised analysis problem.
\item Candidate lists are being checked for biological significance related to methylation
\item Most promising: Combine Naif + Heuristic.
\end{itemize}
